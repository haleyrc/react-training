# Welcome to React quick start!

## Overview

<Notes>
Developed by Facebook, initially release May 2013

Framework for building user interfaces

Organized as a tree of components (more on this later)

Create reusable, single-purpose components

Easy to test

Handles data binding

Handles listeners

Most importantly, handles DOM updates in the quickest way possible

</Notes>

---

### create-react-app

```bash
.
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── public
└── src
```

<Notes>
create-react-app is a utility for bootstrapping a new react project and creates most of the boilerplate you need to get going.

node_modules for vendored dependencies

package.json for build scripts, dependency listings, project info

public for static assets and index.html

src for javascript

</Notes>

---

### index.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />
    <meta
      name="viewport"
      content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"
    />
    <meta name="theme-color" content="#000000" />
    <link rel="manifest" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json" />
    <title>React App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

<Notes>
contains some boilerplate html and a single element under the body with id root

this is where our react application gets mounted

</Notes>

---

### index.js

```js
import React from "react"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom"

ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello, world!</h1>, document.getElementById("root"))
```

<Notes>
The call to ReactDOM.render mounts the application and takes an element and a mount point. You can see the root id again here.

The h1 looks like html, but is actually JSX

</Notes>

---

## JSX

<Notes>
Javascript XML extension to JS syntax, compiled to JS

Other frameworks use things like directives, properties on html elements, but JSX lets us write javascript directly in our templates and vice versa

</Notes>

---

### Under the hood

```js
React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, world!")
```

<Notes>
JSX elements get compiled to javascript calls that create VDOM elements. We'll see an example of the virtual DOM in action later, but it's basically a secondary representation of the DOM that React uses to calculate updates so that the fewest elements possible get rerendered.

Takes type, arguments(props) and children

Used to be written entirely this way

</Notes>

---

### Under the hood

```jsx
<h1 type="notice">
  <div>Hello, world!</div>
  <div>Goodbye!</div>
</h1>
```

becomes:

```js
React.createElement(
  "h1",
  {
    type: "notice"
  },
  React.createElement("div", null, "Hello, world!"),
  React.createElement("div", null, "Goodbye!")
)
```

<Notes>
  Here we see both props and children being passed in, we'll see more of props
  in a bit, but as we can see with the transpiled version, they're basically
  arguments to createElement
</Notes>

---

### Component Tree

![](./public/component_tree.png)

<Notes>
The elements from the previous slide become this component tree

Important: changes to one div _don't_ rerender the other (VDOM in action)

</Notes>

---

## Components

<Notes>
The primary building block of React interfaces. Either

A class with a render method that returns JSX (deprecated)
A function that returns JSX

more on the differences later, but basically it's something that can be rendered (though this might not always be visually)

</Notes>

---

import { UselessCounter } from "./components/Counter"

### The basics

```jsx
function UselessCounter() {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>0</div>
      <button>-</button>
      <button>+</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<UselessCounter />

<Notes>
This is a basic component.

It has a render method that returns some JSX (remember this is still not HTML)

</Notes>

---

import { StatefulCounter } from "./components/Counter"

### State

```jsx
function StatefulCounter() {
  const [count] = React.useState(0)
  return (
    <div>
      <div>{count}</div>
      <button>-</button>
      <button>+</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<StatefulCounter />

<Notes>
State is any information that needs to be stored in your application.

State exists in a lot of different forms, but the first one you'll probably see is local state.

Application state is data, logged in user, a list of vehicles, etc.

UI state is things like IsModalOpen, IsDisabled, etc.

</Notes>

---

import { Counter } from "./components/Counter"

### Events

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  return (
    <div>
      <div>{count}</div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<Counter />

<Notes>
State is useful when we can modify it

The buttons take a function to run when clicked, setCounter updates the state to the new value

Why not just change count directly?

</Notes>

---

import { DumbCounter } from "./components/Counter"

### Reactivity

```jsx
function DumbCounter() {
  let count = 0
  return (
    <div>
      <div>{count}</div>
      <button onClick={() => (count = count - 1)}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => (count = count - 1)}>+</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<DumbCounter />

<Notes>
React has no way of knowing that count has updated, so it doesn't rerender

In olden days, had to wire up listeners to update state on events and manually update UI to match state

</Notes>

---

### Events

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  return (
    <div>
      <div>{count}</div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<Counter />

<Notes>
React keeps track of state updates for us *and* provides a state setter

UI is automatically rerendered when state changes

</Notes>

---

import { PropsCounter } from "./components/Counter"

### Props

```jsx
function PropsCounter(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  const { step } = props // ES6 destructuring syntax
  return (
    <div>
      <div>{count}</div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - step)}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + step)}>+</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<Notes>
Remember, props are arguments to createElement. Get passed to the component.

Change behavior of a component from a parent.

</Notes>

---

### Destructuring

```jsx
function PropsCounter({ step }) {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  return (
    <div>
      <div>{count}</div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - step)}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + step)}>+</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<Notes>
  Destructuring is just a way of obtaining values from an object or array using
  pattern matching
</Notes>

---

### Default props\*

```jsx
function PropsCounter({ step = 1 }) {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  return (
    <div>
      <div>{count}</div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - step)}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + step)}>+</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<Notes>
We can also set a default value using this syntax

\*There are other ways of handling default props, etc., but this is just plain JS, so it's the easiest to understand

</Notes>

---

### Example

```jsx
<PropsCounter />
<PropsCounter step={2}/>
<PropsCounter step={20}/>
```

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "space-between" }}>
  <div>
    <h4>step=1</h4>
    <PropsCounter />
  </div>
  <div style={{ marginLeft: "20px", marginRight: "20px" }}>
    <h4>step=2</h4>
    <PropsCounter step={2} />
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4>step=20</h4>
    <PropsCounter step={20} />
  </div>
</div>

---

import { RainbowCounter } from "./components/Counter"

### Virtual DOM

<RainbowCounter step={1}/>
<RainbowCounter step={2}/>
<RainbowCounter step={20}/>

<Notes>
Virtual DOM at work

Each counter changes background when render is called for that component

Virtual DOM ensures that only the counter whose state changed rerenders

</Notes>

## CSS In JS

<Notes>
You can style react apps like you style anything else with a big ole CSS file and BEM and all that stuff.

React lets you add styles in your components directly and they become inline styles (no more !important), but it gets kind of unwieldy and it's not _quite_ CSS.

Popular options:

Styled components/emotion/glamour/etc.
CSS Modules

Modules let you reuse the same css identifiers without conflicts in different stylesheets.

Styled components let you wrap existing components using a special syntax and then use those the same way you would a regular react component. Mostly personal preference, but both have some tradeoffs.

</Notes>

---

import { CounterWithButtons } from "./components/Counter"

### Example

```jsx
function CounterWithButtons() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  return (
    <div>
      <div>{count}</div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<CounterWithButtons />

---

### Better Example: With Style

```jsx
const StyledButton = styled.button`
  background: #ffd600;
  font-size: 28px;
  font-weight: bold;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  margin: 5px;
  border: none;
  outline: none;
  :hover {
    box-shadow: 0 2px 8px #21212133;
    cursor: pointer;
  }
  :active {
    box-shadow: 0 1px 3px #21212133;
  }
`
```

---

### Better Example: With Style

```jsx
function CounterWithPrettyButtons() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  return (
    <div>
      <div>{count}</div>
      <StyledButton onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>-</StyledButton>
      <StyledButton onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</StyledButton>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<Notes>
Can now use styled button anywhere we need a button and get consistent design.

Build your design system in react.

</Notes>

---

import { CounterWithPrettyButtons } from "./components/Counter"

### 🎉 Ooh Aaaah 🎉

<CounterWithPrettyButtons />

## Hooks

<Notes>
(Very) new feature. Address some shortcomings of previous syntax and add a lot
more utility to SFCs.

Purpose built functions for handling things like effects, state, context, etc.

Weren't in React mainline when sidekick written, will be in frazer web.

</Notes>

---

import { SelfAwareButton } from "./components/Button"

### useState

```jsx
const SelfAwareButton = () => {
  const [clicked, setClicked] = useState(0)
  return (
    <StyledButton onClick={() => setClicked(clicked + 1)}>
      {"Clicked " + clicked + " times."}
    </StyledButton>
  )
}
```

<SelfAwareButton />

<Notes>
useState lets you declare a piece of state that gets persisted between calls. Returns the current state and a setter.

Note: This uses the ES6 arrow function notation

</Notes>

---

import { Greeter, GreeterUpdater } from "./components/Greeter"

### useEffect

```jsx
function Greeter() {
  const [greeting, setGreeting] = React.useState("Hello")

  React.useEffect(() => {
    alert(greeting + ", World!")
  }, [])

  return <button onClick={() => setGreeting("Goodbye")}>Say Goodbye</button>
}
```

<Greeter />

<Notes>
useEffect lets you perform an action during render.
It takes a callback and a dependency list.

Passing an empty array means run on first render only.

It can return an optional cleanup function (e.g. to unregister event listeners, cancel timers, etc.)

Note: Due to the way the slides work, the first call sometimes gets run twice.

</Notes>

---

### useEffect

```jsx
function GreeterUpdater() {
  const [greeting, setGreeting] = React.useState("Hello")

  React.useEffect(() => {
    alert(greeting + ", World!")
  }, [greeting])

  return <button onClick={() => setGreeting("Goodbye")}>Say Goodbye</button>
}
```

<GreeterUpdater />

<Notes>
  In this example, the effect will be rerun whenever greeting changes
</Notes>

---

import App from "./components/Context"

### useContext

```jsx
const LoggedInContext = React.createContext()

const App = () => {
  const [loggedIn, setLoggedIn] = useState(false)
  return (
    <LoggedInContext.Provider value={loggedIn}>
      <Toggle isLoggedIn={loggedIn} onToggle={() => setLoggedIn(!loggedIn)} />
      <div>I'm available to everyone</div>
      <SecureDiv />
    </LoggedInContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

<Notes>
context lets you avoid prop drilling (pass a prop just to pass a prop, etc., etc.)

Create context above where it's needed

Wrap subtree in a provider

Use consumer where you need it to get the value

</Notes>

---

### useContext: Consumer

```jsx
const SecureDiv = () => {
  const isLoggedIn = useContext(LoggedInContext)
  return isLoggedIn ? (
    <div>Visible only when logged in</div>
  ) : (
    <div>Please login to view</div>
  )
}
```

<Notes>
  useContext takes the entire context object and returns the current value
</Notes>

---

<App />

---

## useReducer

```jsx
function countReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INCREMENT": {
      return state + 1
    }
    case "DECREMENT": {
      return state - 1
    }
  }
}

function ReduxCounter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(countReducer, 0)
  return (
    <div>
      <div>{state}</div>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "DECREMENT" })}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" })}>+</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

---

### wut?

---

### useReducer

```jsx
function countReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INCREMENT": {
      return state + (action.step || 1)
    }
    case "DECREMENT": {
      return state - 1
    }
  }
}
```

<Notes>
Reducer is an obtuse name for what is essentially a state machine
It takes the current state and an action and calculates a new state
An action is just an object, so we can attach other properties as well (see next slide for how)

In this case, our "state" is just a count, and we can either increment or decrement it

</Notes>

---

import { ReduxCounter } from "./components/Counter"

### useReducer

```jsx
function ReduxCounter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(countReducer, 0)
  return (
    <div>
      <div>{state}</div>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "DECREMENT" })}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT", step: 10 })}>
        ++
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<ReduxCounter />

<Notes>
  Along with state, we have dispatch, which is how we send actions to the
  reducer To stay consistent, actions should always have a "type", but they can
  have other properties too. They're just objects
</Notes>

---

# Advanced Concepts

---

## Composing Hooks

```jsx
function useCounter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(countReducer, 0)
  const decrement = () => dispatch({ type: "DECREMENT" })
  const increment = () => dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" })
  const incrementMore = () => dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT", step: 10 })
  return { state, decrement, increment, incrementMore }
}
```

<Notes>
  Hooks can be composed to create very powerful but clean interfaces. Custom
  hooks just have to start with "use" and follow all the same rules as normal
  hooks
</Notes>

---

import { CleanerCounter } from "./components/Counter"

### Using a custom hook

```jsx
function CleanerCounter() {
  const { state, decrement, increment, incrementMore } = useCounter()
  return (
    <div>
      <div>{state}</div>
      <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
      <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
      <button onClick={incrementMore}>++</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<CleanerCounter />

---

## Routing

Not part of React proper

Popular options:

- React Navigation
- React Router

<Notes>
  Go with either React Navigation (tried and trued) or React Router. We will be
  using React Router for Frazer 4 stuff.
</Notes>
